Create a plan to complete the project or task scoped to your current location or direction. Ensure it is usable by multiple concurrent Claude Code instances.

The plan will consist of "tracks" that an instance may work on without impacting other instances. Refer to them by id "t-1" and / or name, like "core" or "database".

The plan must coincide with CLAUDE.md and other rules, unless otherwise specified.

Keep a changelog according to industry standards maintained, newest changes at the top, in the root of your scope.
