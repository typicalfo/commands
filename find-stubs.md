Search the entire codebase. Find anything that is stubbed, incomplete, malformed, not implemented, 
or has any indication that is temporary or to be replaced by a real implementation. These can be 
left over code examples, orphaned code, or untested functionality that compiles but will eventually fail.

Create a list. Do not act on it.
